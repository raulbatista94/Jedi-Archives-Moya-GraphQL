# How to run the project?

In order to run properly the project navigate to the folder SWAPI GraphQL.<br>
In there run the next 2 commnads `yarn` and `yarn start`. The first one will install all necessary dependencies while the other will start a local host. <br>
Copy the local hos address and paste it to the `MoyaMoviesCollection` in the param `baseURL`.<br>

This repo is a combination of tutorials from RayWenderlich about Moya and GraphQL.
